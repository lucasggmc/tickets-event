##Comments to the reviewer

I have not used the Angular framework for a while, but with my experience using React and a little Vue, I have done a good job. I will add below what I think could be better and I am also excited to see your code suggestions.

## Further improvements

1 - I would like to create a dropdown that opens to search 
for the possible locations to make the end user experience better
2 - Create a backend middleare to don't expose the API key
3- Create a component for MUI pagination to separate the pagination logic from list component
4 - Handle the errors and Create a Toaster to show the messages
5 - Clear all filters
6 - add a loader to let the user know what is happening
7 - I now it's a requirement, but I could not write unit tests with the given time
